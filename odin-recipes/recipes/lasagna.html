      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>9 lasagna noodles, cooked and drained</li>
      <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step 1: In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over
        medium heat until the beef is browned and the onion is softened. Drain
        any excess fat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, basil,
        oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring
        occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). In a greased 9x13-inch baking
        dish, spread a layer of the meat sauce on the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the
        ricotta cheese over the noodles, followed by 1/3 of the mozzarella
        cheese. Repeat this layering process twice, ending with a layer of
        mozzarella cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 5: Sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese over the lasagna. Cover the
        dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 6: Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until
        the cheese is golden and bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 7: Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few
        minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.
