    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
      <li>2 cans (21 ounces each) cherry pie filling</li>
      <li>3 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>Chocolate shavings for garnish</li>
      <li>Maraschino cherries for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step 1: Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch
        round cake pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder,
        baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: Add the milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract to the
        dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but that's
        okay.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 5: Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans. Bake for 30
        to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the
        cakes comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 6: Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for
        10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 7: Once the cakes are completely cooled, use a serrated knife to
        level the tops if needed. Cut each cake horizontally into two layers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 8: In a separate mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream and powdered
        sugar together until stiff peaks form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 9: Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of
        cherry pie filling on top, followed by a layer of whipped cream. Repeat
        this layering process with the remaining cake layers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 10: Frost the sides and top of the cake with the remaining whipped
        cream. Decorate with chocolate shavings and maraschino cherries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 11: Refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours before serving to
        allow the flavors to meld together.
